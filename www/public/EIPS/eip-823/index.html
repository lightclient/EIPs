    <h2 id="simple-summary">Simple Summary</h2>
<p>A standard for token contracts, providing token exchange services thereby facilitating cross token payments.</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The following standard provides functionally to make payments in the form of any other registered tokens, as well as allow token contracts to store any other tokens in an existing token contract. This standard allows ERC20 token holders to exchange their token with another ERC20 token and use the exchanged tokens to make payments. After a successful payment, the former specified ERC20 tokens, will be stored within the ERC20 token contract they are exchanged with. This proposal uses the term target contract which is used to denote the contract to the token with whom we want to exchange our tokens.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Existing token standards do not provide functionality to exchange tokens. Existing token converters reduce the total supply of an existing token, which in the sense destroys the currency. Token converters do not solve this problem and hence discourages creation of new tokens. This solution does not destroy the existing token but in essence preserve them in the token contract that they are exchanged with, which in turn increases the market value of the latter.</p>

<p>NOTE: After the successful exchange the contract on right owns some tokens of the contract on the left.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Such a design provides a consistent exchange standard 
applicable to all ERC20 tokens that follow it.
The primary advantage for of this strategy is that the exchanged tokens will not be lost. They can either be spent or preserved.
Token convert face a major drawback of destroying tokens after conversion. This mechanism treats tokens like conventional currency where tokens are not destroyed but are stored.</p>
<h2 id="backward-compatibility">Backward Compatibility</h2>
<p>This proposal is fully backward compatible. Tokens extended by this proposal should also be following ERC20 standard. The functionality of ERC20 standard should not be affected by this proposal but will provide additional functionality to it.</p>
