## Abstract
Reduce the intrinsic cost of a transaction from `21,000` to `7,000` gas.

## Motivation
The current `21,000` gas intrinsic cost of a transaction makes sending ETH very costly, often times prohibitively costly for small amounts (tens of USD).
While broad changes to the gas price and first price auction are being considerted in other EIPs, e.g., EIP-1559,
it would be a net positive if the cost of sending ETH can be substantialy reduced in a safe manner.
Such a change is compatible with other approaches pursued in other EIPs.


## Specification
After `block.number >= FORK_BLOCK`, enforce an intrinsic gas cost of `7,000`.

## Rationale

The proliferation of calls to DeFi smart-contracts had substantially increased the cost of making transactions,
since such calls are usually both time sensitive and involve large sums of money.
While the utilization of the chain's capacity by the most valuable transactions is by design,
the high cost of sending transactions pushes users to seek alternatives in other, less-congested chains.
It is true that some users might try to use L2 solutions,
however forcing users to utilize L2 by allowing the user experience of using L1 appears to be a losing strategy (see BTC),
and the safety of many L2 solutions hinges on the ability to use L1 if needed.


Reducing the intrinsic cost of a transaction from `21,000` to `7,000` gas will make sending transactions cheaper,
is easily achievable, and does not incur technical debt.
However, such a change should only be made if it doesn’t negatively affect the user experience and the chain’s security.
Specifically, we must determine this change will not:

* Negtively affect uncle-rate.

* Increase the pace at which the state size of Ethereum grows.

* Enhance gas-manipulation technices (and specifically gas-token). 

, increase the state-sizeHistorically, periods of high transaction counts has correlated with
  higher-than-average uncle blocks being mined. It must be determined that the
  new intrinsic cost `16,360` will not adversely affect.

* The state size of Ethereum continues to grow at an unsustainable pace.
  Increased the transaction throughput will exasperate this problem.

## Security Considerations

#### Increased transactions-per-block
Reducing the intrinsic gas of transaction will lead to an increase of
transactions per block. This has several consequences:

* Historically, periods of high transaction counts has correlated with
  higher-than-average uncle blocks being mined. It must be determined that the
  new intrinsic cost `16,360` will not adversely affect.

* The state size of Ethereum continues to grow at an unsustainable pace.
  Increased the transaction throughput will exasperate this problem.

#### Storage may be accessed more than once
It is difficult to arrive at a fixed-cost for the intrinsic transaction fee,
because it's possible for clients to need to revalidate a transaction in its
mempool. This can be caused artificially by submitting a chain of transactions
and bumping the gas price of the first transaction by minimal step sizes. Since
the first transaction is now a "new" transaction, the transactions that follow
sequentially will need to ensure the account's balance can still afford to
transact.
