## Abstract
Reduce the intrinsic cost of a transaction from `21,000` to `7,000` gas.

## Motivation
The current `21,000` gas intrinsic cost of a transaction makes sending ETH very costly, often times prohibitively costly small amounts (tens of USD).
While broad changes to the gas price and first price auction are being considerted in other EIPs (e.g. EIP-1559),
it would be a net positive if the cost of sending ETH can be substantialy reduced safely.
Such change is compatible with other 


## Specification
After `block.number >= FORK_BLOCK`, enforce an intrinsic gas cost of `16,360`.

## Rationale

The EVM-equivalent of transaction validation would consist mostly of ~110 bytes
of data and 2 x `SLOAD (0x54)`, 2 x `SSTORE (0x55)`, and an `ECRECOVER`. This
translates to `(16 * 110) + 2 * 800 + 2 * 5,000 (assuming account is
initialized) + 3000 = 16,360`. This implies that the current intrinsic cost of
a transaction is overpriced by `4,640` gas. Since validation is implemented
natively, it's possible that this is a conservative estimate.

## Security Considerations

#### Increased transactions-per-block
Reducing the intrinsic gas of transaction will lead to an increase of
transactions per block. This has several consequences:

* Historically, periods of high transaction counts has correlated with
  higher-than-average uncle blocks being mined. It must be determined that the
  new intrinsic cost `16,360` will not adversely affect.

* The state size of Ethereum continues to grow at an unsustainable pace.
  Increased the transaction throughput will exasperate this problem.

#### Storage may be accessed more than once
It is difficult to arrive at a fixed-cost for the intrinsic transaction fee,
because it's possible for clients to need to revalidate a transaction in its
mempool. This can be caused artificially by submitting a chain of transactions
and bumping the gas price of the first transaction by minimal step sizes. Since
the first transaction is now a "new" transaction, the transactions that follow
sequentially will need to ensure the account's balance can still afford to
transact.
